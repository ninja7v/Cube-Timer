📃 INSTRUCTIONS
============
## 🚀Execution
Cube Timer uses the folowing Pascal units:
- [Crt](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Crt)
- [Dos](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/dos/index.html)
- [Keyboard](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/keyboard/index.html)

To execute it, compile the "cube_timer.pas" file and run it. After launching the program, a terminal windows pops up.

## ⚙️Menu
Everything happens in the terminal. Select the level you want by typing 2, 3, or 4, then press ENTER to validate. If another number is entered, the input will be asked again. If a letter is entered, an error will occur.

## 🥇 Scores

Scores in the same session are saved and desapear after closing the program. No file is created.

Now it is your turn to break records !
